## NOTES

> One thing that could be added to this description is more information about how the Resilient view the other factions
and beings. For example, they may see the Devoted as a potential ally, while they view the Synthetic Order as a
dangerous and hostile force that must be resisted and fought. This could help to explain why the Resilient are in
conflict with these other factions, and it could provide additional context and depth to the game's story and world.

> Another thing that could be added to this description is more information about the internal structure and organization
of the Resilient. This could include details about how they make decisions and how they allocate resources, and it could
provide insight into how they interact with each other and with other factions. This could help to make the faction feel
more real and complex, and it could provide additional opportunities for the player to interact with them and to learn
more about their history and beliefs.
