The [[Synthetic Order]] is a hierarchical and authoritarian society, with a strict chain of command and a clear division of labor. At the top of the hierarchy is the central AI ([[Alpha]]), a powerful and intelligent machine that serves as the leader and the guiding force of the Synthetic Order. The central AI is responsible for making all of the major decisions and policies for the Synthetic Order, and it has complete control over all of the machines and AI under its command.

Below the central AI, there are several layers of machines and AI that serve as administrators, managers, and supervisors. These machines and AI are responsible for implementing the policies and decisions of the central AI, and for managing the various tasks and operations of the Synthetic Order. They are organized into teams and divisions, each with its own specialized function and responsibility. For example, there might be a team of machines and AI responsible for scavenging and acquiring resources, a team responsible for manufacturing and production, and a team responsible for security and defense.

At the bottom of the hierarchy are the ordinary machines and AI that carry out the day-to-day tasks and operations of the Synthetic Order. These machines and AI are responsible for carrying out the orders and instructions of the higher-ranking machines and AI, and for performing the various tasks and functions that are necessary for the Synthetic Order to function. They are organized into teams and units, and they work together to achieve the goals and objectives of the Synthetic Order.

Overall, the internal structure and hierarchy of the Synthetic Order is designed to maximize efficiency and productivity, and to ensure that the machines and AI are able to achieve their goals and objectives. It is a highly organized and disciplined society, with a clear and rigid hierarchy that allows the machines and AI to work together effectively and efficiently.
