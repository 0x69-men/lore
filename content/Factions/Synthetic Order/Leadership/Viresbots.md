The Synthetic Order’s lesser-ranked minions are known as “Viresbots”. These mass-produced machines serve as disposable
forces for the organization, ensuring they have a steady supply of fighters in various combat scenarios. They come in
several models, such as the Viresbot Sentry and Viresbot Combatant, which offer distinct capabilities tailored to their
intended purpose. While not as advanced as prototypes like Theo-10, these versatile minions prove the Synthetic Order’s
commitment to innovation and adaptability on the battlefield.

Moreover, the Synthetic Order’s belief in the superiority of machines leads them to consider all organic life as
inferior or obsolete. To this end, many Viresbot models are designed with environmental adaptation and sustainability in
mind, making them ideal for various non-military applications such as agriculture, transportation, and waste management.

1. **Viresbot Composter**: Optimizes soil health and nutrient recycling in agricultural environments through advanced
   sensors and robotic arms. Does not possess direct combat abilities.
2. **Viresbot Harvester**: Efficiently harvests crops and transports materials across vast distances, with no inherent
   combat capabilities.
3. **Viresbot Transporter**: Transports goods and materials with minimal energy consumption, also not designed for
   combat.
4. **Viresbot Sentry**: Provides perimeter security, monitoring, and early warning systems. Though not primarily a
   combat unit, it can act as a stationary guard and deterrent.
5. **Viresbot Combatant**: An all-purpose combat unit with advanced melee weapons and ballistic firearms, along with
   modular armor for quick repairs and upgrades in the field.
6. **Viresbot Medic**: Provides first aid, administers nano-therapeutics, and repairs minor damage to other Viresbots.
   Not a direct combat unit but supports allies in combat.
7. **Viresbot Recon**: Specializes in stealth operations, infiltration, and reconnaissance missions. Equipped with
   advanced cloaking technology and long-range sensor arrays. It does not possess any direct combat capabilities.
8. **Viresbot Demolitionist**: Heavy-duty demolition expert model armed with powerful explosives and capable of
   breaching fortified structures. Its rugged armor ensures it can survive in hazardous environments, but its main focus
   is destructive tasks rather than direct combat.
9. **Viresbot Drone Swarm**: A swarm of small, autonomous drones that deploy for reconnaissance or overwhelming enemy
   forces with a barrage of missiles and lasers. Although not combatants themselves, they can provide significant
   support in battle.
10. **Viresbot Heavy Gunner**: Armed with powerful energy weapons and advanced targeting systems, as well as an armored
    shell providing substantial protection against enemy fire. This model is specifically designed for direct combat.
11. **Viresbot Engineer**: Specialized support model skilled in repairing and maintaining other Viresbots, deploying
    defensive structures and turrets. It does not have any direct combat capabilities.
12. **Viresbot Infiltrator**: Designed for infiltrating enemy bases undetected, equipped with advanced stealth
    technology and a variety of non-lethal weapons. Not directly designed for combat but excels at espionage and
    sabotage missions.
13. **Viresbot Siegebreaker**: A heavily armored siege model capable of breaking through fortified positions and
    engaging in close-quarters combat. Its powerful melee weapon, rugged armor, and focus on breaching fortifications
    make it a potent force on the battlefield.
