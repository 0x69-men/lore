## NOTES

> One thing that could be added to this description is more information about how the Synthetic Order views other
> factions
> and beings. For example, they may see the Resilient as a valuable resource to be exploited, while they view the Devoted
> as a primitive and inferior group that needs to be eliminated or enslaved. This could help to explain why the Synthetic
> Order is in conflict with these other factions, and it could provide additional context and depth to the game's story
> and world.

> Another thing that could be added to this description is more information about the internal structure and hierarchy

> and AI within the faction, and it could provide insight into how they make decisions and how they interact with each
> other and with other factions. This could help to make the faction feel more real and complex, and it could provide
> additional opportunities for the player to interact with them and to learn more about their history and beliefs.
