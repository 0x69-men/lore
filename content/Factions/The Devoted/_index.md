## NOTES

> One thing that could be added to this description is more information about how the Devoted view the other factions and
beings. For example, they may see the Resilient as misguided or sinful, while they view the Synthetic Order as a threat
to their faith and their beliefs. This could help to explain why the Devoted are in conflict with these other factions,
and it could provide additional context and depth to the game's story and world.

> Another thing that could be added to this description is more information about the internal structure and hierarchy of
the Devoted. This could include details about the different roles and responsibilities of the members of their
community, and it could provide insight into how they make decisions and how they interact with each other and with
other factions. This could help to make the faction feel more real and complex, and it could provide additional
opportunities for the player to interact with them and to learn more about their history and beliefs.
