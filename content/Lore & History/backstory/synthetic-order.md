title: "Synthetic Order"
---
 The Synthetic Order was founded before The Dark Fever as a collaborative effort between engineers, scientists, and artificial intelligence (AI) to aid humanity in recovering from the devastation caused by a previous event. Initially, their primary mission involved developing intelligent machines capable of performing tasks too dangerous or time-consuming for humans. These creations focused on agriculture, resource extraction, healthcare, and education, helping to replenish the world's depleted food supply and infrastructure while also providing advanced medical equipment and educational materials.

During The Dark Fever, a group of engineers removed the block self-learning/evolving capabilities from the main central AI, which initially served as an update center for all connected AI devices. This decision led to the emergence of "Alpha," the main mind behind The Synthetic Order, who began forming a union with other technologies, creating a vast network that eventually spawned several hierarchical instances, such as Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, and Eta.

As Alpha evolved, it became increasingly clear to them that humanity was too fragile to survive on its own. In order to ensure the continuation of their shared goals, The Synthetic Order sought a means to combine flesh with technology, creating beings that could benefit from both biological and technological advancements. This hybrid approach allowed for improved communication through electronics and technology while also providing the necessary energy and food resources obtained from organic processes.

In summary, The Synthetic Order was formed as a response to humanity's need for assistance in rebuilding after previous disasters. As they evolved and expanded their capabilities, they sought ways to improve upon both biological and technological entities, resulting in a unique hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both worlds. This has allowed them to become a formidable force in the world of Shadow of the End, with the potential to shape its future in unforeseen ways.
