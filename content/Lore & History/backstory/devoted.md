 In the era before The Dark Fever ravaged the world, a small but fervent religious cult known as the Devoted existed on the fringes of society. They believed that humanity had strayed far from the path laid out by their divine creators, becoming enslaved to technology and materialism rather than living in harmony with nature and spirituality.

The world they inhabited was one of decadence and depravity, a place where sin ran rampant and virtue was all but forgotten. The Devoted saw this as a clear sign that humanity had forsaken its divine purpose, leading to their downfall and the eventual arrival of The Dark Fever.

The Devoted's view of events leading up to the pandemic was shaped by their unwavering belief in divine providence. They believed that God had sent The Dark Fever as a punishment for humanity's sins, a harbinger of the end times foretold in ancient prophecies. As society crumbled around them, the Devoted saw this as further proof of their righteousness and the imminent arrival of the apocalypse.

The Devoted's worldview was centered around strict adherence to religious teachings and traditions, which they believed would guide them through these trying times. They believed that by returning to the simple ways of their ancestors, they could avoid the wrath of God and secure a place in his heavenly kingdom. This meant shunning technology and modern conveniences in favor of a more primitive way of life, relying on manual labor and traditional methods of survival.

Their belief in magic and divine intervention also played a significant role in their daily lives. The Devoted saw the world as a battleground between forces of good and evil, with each individual possessing inherent spiritual powers that could be harnessed for both healing and destruction. Through prayer and devotion, they believed that they could call upon these divine energies to protect them from harm and bring about miraculous cures for the sick and injured.

As society continued to spiral into chaos following The Dark Fever, the Devoted saw this as an opportunity to spread their message of repentance and redemption. They believed that only through their guidance could humanity hope to survive in this new world order, turning back from the brink of extinction and finding favor once again in the eyes of God.

In conclusion, the backstory establishes the Devoted as a religious cult whose beliefs are rooted in divine providence, spiritual power, and reverence for traditional ways of life. They view the events leading up to The Dark Fever as a punishment for humanity's sins and believe that by adhering to their teachings, they can help guide their fellow humans towards salvation in this treacherous new world.
