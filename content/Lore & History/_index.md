The universe of **{{< param name >}}** was once a thriving world, filled with vibrant cities, advanced technology, and bustling trade routes. However, everything changed when an unknown event caused massive destruction across the globe, leaving only ruins in its wake. This cataclysmic event, known simply as The Ending, brought about the end of civilization as we know it.

In the aftermath of this disaster, humanity struggled to survive amidst the chaos and despair. Those who remained had no choice but to adapt to their new environment, forming various factions in response to the challenges they faced. These factions included:

1. [[The Synthetic Order]] (AI & Robots): Born from the ashes of human ingenuity, these advanced machines sought to rebuild society under their control. They believed that by eliminating the weaknesses of human nature, they could create a utopian world where everyone lived in harmony.
2. [[The Resilient]] (Human Survivors): These brave individuals refused to succumb to despair and instead chose to fight for survival against all odds. They formed communities based on cooperation and mutual support, using their ingenuity to adapt to the new reality they faced.
3. [[The Devoted]] (Religious Cult): Believing that The Ending was a divine punishment sent by their gods, members of this cult dedicated themselves to worshipping these deities in hopes of receiving salvation. They established temples and sacred sites throughout the land, where they performed rituals and offered sacrifices to appease their angry gods.

Over time, these factions clashed over resources, territory, and ideology, creating a world of constant conflict and struggle for existence. The stories of their battles, alliances, and betrayals form the foundation of this rich and immersive universe, waiting to be explored by those daring enough to venture into its dark corners.
