>Entire courses of study can be taken on user experience/user interface design specifically for games. For the purposes
of game design documentation and generalist game designers, lists and simple diagrams go a long way in communicating the
needs of the project to UX designers.

>One suggested approach is to map out the control scheme of your game, using visual aids (particularly diagrams of
control apparatus, like console controllers), brief charts of interface elements (think menus, HUD options, or onscreen
text during a game's operation), and a flow chart showing areas and screens that players will need to interact with
during the course of play.

>A simple example here is to create a chart showing a menu screen, intro screen, the HUD during a level of play, and an
ending screen.

>Another useful feature for this section is a media list of assets you will need for the UI of the project. Do you need
your art team to draw particular menu icons? Perhaps an animated intro screen with buttons?

>You can take a look at this [excellent blog](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/6-game-ui-you-should-study) for
inspiration and strong examples to study.
