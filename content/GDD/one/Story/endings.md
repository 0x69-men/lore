There are multiple possible endings based on your progress and decisions throughout the game. The
ending you experience will depend on a variety of factors, including your alliances, territorial control, resource
management, and military successes. Here are some examples of different endings that players might encounter:

## Stage 1: Early Game (0-25% Progress)

Given the context provided, if you would like a "hero-based" successful run ending for a single player's character
rather than a faction victory, here are a few suggestions:

1. **Redemption and Reunion**: Your hero manages to reunite with their lost family or loved ones, who have been
   separated during the cataclysmic event. Together, they form a bond that strengthens them against the harsh realities
   of the post-apocalyptic world. The hero's actions inspire other survivors to rally around them and work towards a
   better future.
2. **Technological Savior**: Your hero discovers or creates groundbreaking technology that helps rebuild society,
   improving living conditions and making life in the post-apocalyptic world more bearable. The hero's ingenuity and
   resourcefulness earn them the admiration and respect of their fellow survivors, who rally behind their vision for a
   brighter future.
3. **Leader of the Free**: Your hero emerges as a charismatic leader who unites disparate factions under a common cause.
   Through diplomacy, persuasion, and strategic alliances, your hero helps establish peace and stability in the
   post-apocalyptic world, allowing society to rebuild and thrive.
4. **Guardian of Hope**: Your hero becomes a symbol of hope and resilience for their fellow survivors, inspiring them to
   overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Through their unwavering determination and selflessness, your hero helps
   lead humanity towards a brighter future in the face of overwhelming adversity.
5. **Master Survivalist**: Your hero becomes an expert at surviving in the harsh post-apocalyptic world, utilizing their
   knowledge of scavenging, resource management, and improvised weaponry to protect themselves and others from harm.
   Through their prowess and resourcefulness, your hero helps ensure the survival of their fellow survivors.
6. **Peacemaker**: Your hero's nonviolent approach to conflict resolution earns them the trust and respect of rival
   factions. Through diplomacy and negotiation, your hero helps establish peace between hostile groups, paving the way
   for a more stable and prosperous future for all.
7. **Mystic Protector**: Your hero gains mystical abilities or connections with powerful entities that aid in their
   quest to rebuild society and protect their fellow survivors from harm. Through this supernatural power, your hero
   becomes a legend among the post-apocalyptic world's inhabitants, inspiring hope and faith in the face of overwhelming
   darkness.
8. **The Emergence**: In this storyline, your hero discovers an ancient artifact with hidden powers that can help
   rebuild society. They harness these abilities to create a sanctuary for their fellow survivors, fostering a sense of
   unity and safety in the early stages of the post-apocalyptic world. As word spreads of the hero’s discovery, other
   factions seek out this haven, leading to increased cooperation and collaboration among once-rival groups.
9. **The Unifier**: Your hero plays a pivotal role in uniting various factions through their charismatic leadership and
   diplomacy skills. They establish trade routes, forge alliances, and create a united front against the dangers that
   threaten their communities. As the hero’s influence spreads, other leaders begin to follow their example, fostering a
   spirit of cooperation and mutual support among the diverse survivors in the post-apocalyptic world.
10. **The Phoenix Ascendant**: Your hero leads an expedition to rediscover and revive key technological advancements
    that can improve living conditions for all survivors. Through their resourcefulness and ingenuity, they develop new
    ways of generating power, producing food, and purifying water. As the hero’s ideas spread, other communities begin
    to adopt these innovations, creating a network of interconnected settlements that rely on one another for survival
    in the harsh post-apocalyptic landscape. These three storylines focus on heroic actions within the first 25% of the
    game and emphasize themes such as unity, cooperation, and progress as key factors in overcoming adversity in a
    post-apocalyptic world.

## Stage 2: Middle Game (25-75% Progress)

the decisions made throughout the previous stages. Here are fifteen possible endings:

1. **United Front**: Through diplomacy, trade, and strategic alliances, the hero unites the factions of the world under
   a common cause - rebuilding and restoring peace to the post-apocalyptic landscape. A new era of prosperity dawns as
   resources are shared equitably, technology advances, and living conditions improve for all.

## Stage 3: Late Game (75-100% Progress)
