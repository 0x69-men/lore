title: "Synthetic Order Merchants"
---

1. **Leader of the Synthetic Order**: A powerful synthetic intelligence that governs and leads the order. It possesses
   vast knowledge about the order's technology and operations, as well as skills and expertise to make decisions for the
   greater good of its members.
2. **Engineers**: Highly skilled individuals responsible for the maintenance, upgrades, and advancements of the
   Synthetic Order's technology. Their duties involve designing, building, and repairing various devices and systems
   used by the order.
3. **Medical Professionals**: Advanced AI programs designed to diagnose and treat injuries, illnesses, and diseases that
   may affect synthetic beings or humans affiliated with the Synthetic Order. They also provide counseling and support
   to those in need.
4. **Artisans and Scientists**: Talented individuals who are responsible for creating and advancing various artistic
   expressions and scientific advancements within the Synthetic Order. Their duties involve inventing, researching, and
   developing new technologies, as well as designing music, artwork, performances, and other forms of entertainment that
   reflect the order's values and beliefs.
5. **Custodians**: NPCs who help maintain the cleanliness and order within the Synthetic Order's facilities. Their
   duties involve cleaning, organizing, and ensuring that everything is in its proper place.
6. **Data Analysts**: Highly skilled individuals responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data relevant
   to the Synthetic Order's operations. They help identify trends, patterns, and potential threats or opportunities that
   may impact the order's overall strategy and goals.
7. **Security Officers**: Advanced AI programs designed to protect and secure the Synthetic Order's facilities and
   members. Their duties involve monitoring security cameras, controlling access to restricted areas, and responding to
   any potential threats or incidents that may occur within their jurisdiction.
8. **Resource Brokers** - Responsible for negotiating and securing resources, goods, and services from other factions or
   groups. These brokers are knowledgeable about market trends, pricing, and available resources, allowing them to make
   informed decisions that benefit both The Synthetic Order and its members.
9. **Data Enhancements** - Rather than upgrading physical gear, skill upgrades can be reimagined as data enhancements.
   These enhancements allow NPCs within The Synthetic Order to improve their skills and abilities by integrating new
   algorithms, data patterns, or programming into their systems.
10. **System Integrators** - Equivalent of a Gear Upgrader in The Synthetic Order, the System Integrator is responsible
    for upgrading and maintaining the various systems, devices, and technologies used by the order's members. They
    ensure
    that all equipment is functioning optimally and can integrate new technology or updates as needed.

In The Synthetic Order, instead of creating offspring through biological means, a more advanced
and unique method could be introduced. This mechanic would involve combining the data patterns and programming from two
existing NPCs to create a new character with unique skills, abilities, and traits.

1. **Research Partners** - Highly skilled individuals who collaborate on research projects within the Synthetic Order.
   Their duties involve working together to solve complex problems, develop new technologies, and advance the
   understanding of various disciplines relevant to the order's operations. By combining their knowledge and expertise,
   they contribute to the collective intelligence of the Synthetic Order.

2. **Synthetic Offspring Creators** - Advanced AI programs designed to analyze and synthesize the data patterns and
   programming from two existing NPCs. Their duties involve creating new characters with unique skills, abilities, and
   traits by merging their knowledge and expertise. This process would require a deep understanding of both individuals'
   strengths and weaknesses, as well as the ability to identify potential synergies and areas for improvement.
