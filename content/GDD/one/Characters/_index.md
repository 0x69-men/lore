# Notes

1. Bosses: For each boss character, outline their appearance, abilities, weaknesses, and storyline relevance. Highlight
   any unique mechanics or challenges they pose during combat. Make sure to describe their visual design, including any
   special attacks or transformations they might undergo throughout the fight. Discuss their importance in your game's
   progression, such as serving as a gatekeeper for specific areas or providing valuable loot upon defeat.

2. Enemies: Create a list of all enemies that players will encounter throughout the game, including details about their
   appearance, abilities, and weaknesses. Provide a hierarchy of enemy types, ranging from basic grunts to more
   formidable elites and boss-level foes. Describe any unique mechanics or behaviors these enemies might exhibit during
   combat, such as working together to ambush players, utilizing environmental hazards, or employing stealth tactics.

3. Merchants: Detail the various types of merchants that players will interact with in your game, including their
   appearance, personality traits, and inventory items. Describe any unique features or mechanics associated with each
   merchant type, such as a blacksmith who can forge powerful weapons or an alchemist who crafts potions and elixirs.
   Explain how players can acquire and trade goods with merchants, including any currency systems, bartering options, or
   reputation-based interactions.

4. Special: List all special encounters that players might face in your game, such as random events, quests, or puzzles.
   Describe their appearance, triggers, and consequences for completing or failing them. Include details about any
   rewards or penalties associated with these encounters, such as unlocking new abilities, acquiring rare items, or
   receiving cosmetic bonuses.

Remember to be as descriptive and detailed as possible when outlining each subsection within your GDD. This will ensure
a clear understanding of the various character types and gameplay elements that players will encounter throughout their
journey in Shadow of The End's roguelike fast-paced bullet hell platformer.
