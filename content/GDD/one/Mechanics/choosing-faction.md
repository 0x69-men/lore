## Choosing a Faction and Its Consequences

At the beginning of each playthrough, players will be given the opportunity to choose which faction they wish to align
themselves with. This decision will grant them unique abilities, upgrades, and advantages that are specific to their
chosen group, allowing them to develop a more personalized strategy as they navigate through the game world.

The three factions available for players to join are:

1. The Synthetic Order - A society of artificial intelligence and robots that believe in their superiority over humans
   and aim to rule the world and shape its future. Joining this faction will grant players access to advanced
   technologies, enhanced combat abilities, and a network of AI allies who can assist them in their journey.
2. The Resilient - A group of survivors immune to the pandemic that has devastated the world. Their goal is to rebuild
   and restore society, creating a better future for themselves and their descendants. By joining this faction, players
   will have access to medical expertise, increased resistance to diseases, and the ability to establish thriving
   communities throughout the game world.
3. The Devoted - A mysterious cult that has arisen in the aftermath of the catastrophic event. They believe in a higher
   power and seek to honor their divine purpose by performing various rituals and ceremonies. By joining this faction,
   players will gain access to powerful magical abilities, mysterious artifacts, and the support of other devout
   followers who share their beliefs.

Throughout the game, players can have offsprings with different factions, depending on their relationships and
alliances. The acceptability of these offsprings by specific factions may vary, influencing their growth and development
within the game world. Furthermore, each playthrough's faction choice will be carried over to future generations through
genealogy, which can result in new strategies and dynamics as players navigate their way through the ever-evolving
landscape of the post-apocalyptic world.

In addition to these existing mechanics, we now introduce a new system where offsprings are directly based on rest areas
and where the player sleeps overnight. The acceptability of these offsprings by specific factions will be determined by
their proximity to different faction territories at the time of conception. This means that if a player sleeps in an
area dominated by one faction while having a relationship with another, the offspring's acceptance may be influenced by
this choice. For instance:

- If a player sleeps near a Synthetic Order territory and is allied with The Resilient, their offspring might receive
  some benefits from both factions, but it could also lead to conflicts or complications due to the differing ideologies
  of these groups.
- Similarly, if a player sleeps in an area controlled by The Devoted but maintains relationships with other factions,
  their offspring may be more accepted by The Devoted while still being influenced by the other alliances.
  This new system adds another layer of complexity and strategy to the game, as players will need to carefully consider
  their location choices and sleeping arrangements to ensure that their offspring receive the best possible support and
  acceptance from their chosen factions.
