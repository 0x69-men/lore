## Rest Areas and Permanent Progression - Hubs, NPC Trading, and Reputation

Between each level or generation in the game world, players will have access to rest areas where they can pause their
journey, regroup, and prepare for the challenges that lie ahead. These hub towns serve as central locations for players
to interact with various non-playable characters (NPCs) and engage in trade, forming strategic alliances or acquiring
valuable resources that will aid them throughout their adventure.

As the player continues their journey through each new playthrough, they will be able to add new NPCs to the hub towns
they visit. These newcomers will bring with them unique items, services, and opportunities for trade, further enriching
the game world and giving players more options to consider when planning their strategies.

In addition to adding new NPCs, the player's actions during each playthrough will also have a lasting impact on the hub
towns they visit. As infrastructure and buildings are built, roads are expanded, and the overall population of these
settlements grows, they will remain in place for future generations to experience and explore. This permanent
progression ensures that each new game is set within a richly developed world that feels alive and constantly evolving.

However, players should be mindful of their reputation within these hub towns. If their actions cause them to become
unwelcome or untrusted by the inhabitants, they may find it increasingly difficult to access certain areas or engage in
trade with specific NPCs. This added layer of complexity encourages players to think carefully about their choices and
consider the long-term consequences of their decisions on both themselves and the world around them.

To incorporate the new offspring mechanics based on rest areas and where the player sleeps overnight, we can expand the
existing "Choosing a Faction and Its Consequences" subsection as follows:
