The player's base movement speed should be relatively high to enable quick navigation through the game world. The jump
height could also be designed with a decent vertical range, allowing players to overcome certain obstacles and explore
new areas.

### Surface

Different types of surfaces can affect the player's movement and jumping abilities in various ways:

1. Solid ground: This is your default surface where the player has their maximum speed and jump height. Movement should
   feel smooth and responsive on solid ground, allowing players to quickly change direction as needed.

2. Slopes: When moving or jumping along sloped surfaces, the player's movement speed and jump height may be reduced.
   However, they can still maintain a reasonable level of control over their character's trajectory when moving downhill
   or uphill. In addition, slopes could introduce some additional challenge by requiring players to adjust their
   movements accordingly.

3. Water: When navigating water bodies, the player's speed might be significantly reduced due to the resistance provided
   by the liquid. Jumping into water may also cause a slight splash effect that temporarily decreases the player's
   movement and jump abilities until they emerge from the water. This can create interesting gameplay moments where
   players must strategize their movements and timing when traversing bodies of water.

4. Ice or slippery surfaces: These could be implemented as a special type of surface that causes the player's character
   to slide or skid uncontrollably in a specific direction. To counteract this, players may need to learn how to
   maintain their balance and adjust their movements accordingly when navigating icy or slippery surfaces.

5. Lava or hazardous environments: These surfaces can pose significant challenges for the player as they may cause
   instant death upon contact. However, some level of interaction with these surfaces might be possible, such as jumping
   over them or finding alternative paths around them. This creates an added layer of difficulty and encourages players
   to explore different routes through the game world.

### Wall Jumping

1. Wall-jumping: Implement a wall-jump mechanic that allows players to bounce off walls while moving at high speeds.
   This can be activated when the player is close to a wall and presses the jump button or another designated input. The
   angle of the wall-jump can be adjusted using the directional inputs, enabling players to change their trajectory and
   reach new heights or areas within the game world.

2. Wall-climbing: Design a wall-climbing ability that lets players scale vertical surfaces at a slower pace than regular
   movement. This mechanic could be activated by holding down a specific button or trigger, causing the player's
   character to automatically climb up walls until they reach their maximum climbing height. To descend from a wall,
   players can either let go of the input or jump off the surface.

3. Surface interactions: Different types of surfaces can affect how effectively players can use their wall-jumping and
   wall-climbing abilities. For example, slippery walls may cause characters to slide uncontrollably during a wall-jump,
   while ice or lava walls could result in instant death upon contact. These interactions will add an extra layer of
   challenge and strategy to the gameplay, encouraging players to explore various routes through the game world and find
   new ways to overcome obstacles.

4. Combining abilities: To create a more dynamic and engaging experience, consider allowing players to combine their
   wall-jumping and wall-climbing abilities with other actions, such as shooting, dashing, or performing advanced
   maneuvers like air dodges. This will enable players to adapt their playstyle according to different situations and
   enemies they encounter throughout the game.

5. Puzzle elements: Wall-jumping and wall-climbing mechanics can also be integrated into puzzle elements within the
   game. For instance, you could design levels where players must use these abilities to reach specific locations or
   activate switches, thereby solving puzzles and progressing through the game world.

### Momentum-based movement

1. Running and consecutive jumps: Players should gain momentum as they run or jump consecutively, allowing them to
   achieve increased speeds and heights. This can be achieved by gradually increasing the speed and height of the
   character's movements over time, based on how long the player holds down the movement or jump inputs.

2. Dynamic momentum loss: To maintain the game's fast-paced nature, consider implementing a dynamic momentum loss system
   that slows players down once they stop running or jumping. This can be achieved by gradually reducing the character's
   speed and height after a certain period of inactivity, encouraging players to keep moving and jump consecutively to
   maintain their momentum.

3. Interactions with surfaces: Different types of surfaces can affect how effectively players can use their
   momentum-based movement abilities. For example, slopes could provide additional speed boosts when running or jumping
   downhill, while ice or lava walls may cause characters to lose momentum faster upon contact. These interactions will
   add an extra layer of challenge and strategy to the gameplay, encouraging players to explore various routes through
   the game world and find new ways to overcome obstacles.

4. Combining abilities: To create a more dynamic and engaging experience, consider allowing players to combine their
   movement-based momentum abilities with other actions, such as shooting, dashing, or performing advanced maneuvers
   like air dodges. This will enable players to adapt their playstyle according to different situations and enemies they
   encounter throughout the game.

5. Puzzle elements: Momentum can also be integrated into puzzle elements within the game. For instance, you could design
   levels where players must use their momentum-based movement abilities to reach specific locations or activate
   switches, thereby solving puzzles and progressing through the game world.

6. Skill-based gameplay: Emphasize the importance of skill and precision in maintaining momentum by introducing various
   challenges that test the player's ability to control their character's movements effectively. For example, you could
   design sections where players must navigate through narrow passages or jump across gaps while maintaining their speed
   and height, requiring them to time their jumps and maneuvers carefully.

7. Momentum-based combos: Incorporate a momentum-based combo system that rewards players for performing consecutive
   jumps and running movements without interruption. This can be achieved by awarding additional points or bonuses for
   each successful combo, encouraging players to master the game's movement mechanics and showcase their skills during
   gameplay.

### Dashing/sprinting

1. Dashing or sprinting ability: The player should be able to perform a quick dash or sprint by pressing a designated
   button or key combination. This action will temporarily increase their movement speed, allowing them to quickly
   escape dangerous situations or cover large distances in the game world.

2. Limited usage: To maintain the game's fast-paced nature and encourage strategic decision-making, consider limiting
   the number of times players can use their dashing or sprinting ability within a certain period. This could be
   achieved by implementing a cooldown timer that resets after a predetermined amount of time has passed since the last
   dash or sprint was performed.

3. Interactions with surfaces: Different types of surfaces can affect how effectively players can use their dashing or
   sprinting abilities. For example, slippery floors could reduce the effectiveness of dashes and sprints, while ice or
   lava walls may cause characters to lose momentum faster upon contact. These interactions will add an extra layer of
   challenge and strategy to the gameplay, encouraging players to explore various routes through the game world and find
   new ways to overcome obstacles.

4. Combining abilities: To create a more dynamic and engaging experience, consider allowing players to combine their
   dashing or sprinting abilities with other actions, such as shooting, jumping, or performing advanced maneuvers like
   air dodges. This will enable players to adapt their playstyle according to different situations and enemies they
   encounter throughout the game.

5. Puzzle elements: Dashing or sprinting can also be integrated into puzzle elements within the game. For instance, you
   could design levels where players must use their dashing or sprinting abilities to reach specific locations or
   activate switches, thereby solving puzzles and progressing through the game world.

6. Skill-based gameplay: Emphasize the importance of skill and precision in using your dashing or sprinting ability by
   introducing various challenges that test the player's ability to control their character's movements effectively. For
   example, you could design sections where players must navigate through narrow passages or jump across gaps while
   maintaining their speed, requiring them to time their dashes and maneuvers carefully.

7. Momentum-based combos: Incorporate a momentum-based combo system that rewards players for performing consecutive
   dashes and running movements without interruption. This can be achieved by awarding additional points or bonuses for
   each successful combo, encouraging players to master the game's movement mechanics and showcase their skills during
   gameplay.

## Controls

Basic controls for movement, jumping, dashing, and other essential actions should be designed with intuitive and
responsive inputs in mind. For example:

- Movement: The player can use the left analog stick or arrow keys to control their character's movements (
  left/right/up/down). Diagonal movements could also be incorporated for added precision.

- Jumping: A simple press of the jump button (usually "A" or "Space") should initiate a basic jump, while a combination
  of the jump and another input (e.g., holding down a direction on the analog stick) can trigger double-jumps or other
  advanced maneuvers.

- Dashing/sprinting: A separate button or trigger (e.g., "B" or left trigger) could be used to activate a temporary
  speed boost, allowing players to quickly escape dangerous situations or cover large distances in the game world.

These basic controls and surface interactions will form the foundation of your game's movement mechanics, providing
players with a dynamic and engaging experience as they navigate through the Shadow of the End universe.
