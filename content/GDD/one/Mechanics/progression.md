In order to incorporate the concept of multiple generations and different endings based on world progress, you can
expand upon the existing story elements and player choices by introducing the following features:

## End-game Progression

Game introduces a new layer of depth and complexity to its gameplay through the implementation of
multi-generational storytelling. As you navigate the world and make critical decisions that impact your faction,
alliances, and territory control, you will find yourself shaping the course of history for generations to come.

End-game progression in game is divided into several distinct stages, each with its own set of challenges,
objectives, and consequences. As you progress through these stages, you will be faced with a series of pivotal decisions
that will determine the fate of your faction and the world at large.

## Stage 1: Early Game (0-25% Progress)

During this stage, players are introduced to the world and its various factions, resources, and
challenges. They must establish their base, gather resources, and make alliances with other factions in order to survive
and grow. As they progress through this stage, they will begin to uncover the secrets of the world and the truth behind
the mysterious events that have brought them to this point.

## Stage 2: Middle Game (25-75% Progress)

In this stage, players must navigate a complex web of political intrigue, resource management, and military strategy as
they work to expand their influence and power across the game world. They will be faced with difficult decisions that
will have lasting consequences for generations to come, as they strive to secure their faction's position in the world.
The choices made during this stage will determine which of the possible endings players will ultimately experience.

## Stage 3: Late Game (75-100% Progress)

As players reach the late game stage, they will find themselves at the precipice of a new era for their faction and the
world as a whole. They must make the most crucial decisions of all, as they shape the course of history for generations
to come. These choices will determine not only the immediate fate of their faction but also the long-term consequences
that will reverberate through the ages.
