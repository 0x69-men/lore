## Death Consequences - Future Foes and Legacy Mutation

When a player character dies during gameplay, the circumstances surrounding their demise will have lasting effects on
the evolving legacy mechanic. Depending on how they died, their descendants may encounter different types of adversaries
in future generations, each with distinct abilities and characteristics based on the original character's death cause.

- **Mutation into Future Foes:** If a player dies as a result of being exposed to mutagens or other hazardous substances
  found within the world, their descendants may face off against creatures that share traits similar to their
  ancestors'. The appearance and abilities of these future foes will be influenced by the specific mutations that
  occurred at the time of death.
- **Bio Android Conversion by Synthetic Order:** If a player is captured and converted into a bio android by the
  Synthetic Order, their descendants may encounter similar creatures in future generations. These bio-androids will
  possess advanced technology and abilities, reflecting the original character's transformation.
- **Undead Resurrection by The Devoted:** In cases where a player is resurrected by members of The Devoted, their
  descendants might come across undead creatures with similar attributes to their ancestor's. These undead foes will
  have unique abilities and powers derived from the dark arts used in their resurrection.
- **Other Ways to Become Future Foes:** If a player dies under other circumstances, their descendants may face off
  against different types of adversaries that reflect the unique challenges or consequences of their death. The
  appearance and abilities of these future foes will be determined by the context of the character's demise.

This additional mechanic provides an extra layer of complexity to the "Evolving Legacy Mechanic," giving players even
more reasons to think carefully about how they approach each playthrough and ensuring that no two games are ever quite
alike. The consequences of their actions not only affect future generations but also shape the types of adversaries they
encounter, making each new game a unique and engaging experience.
