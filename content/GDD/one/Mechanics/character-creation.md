## Evolving Legacy Mechanic

The game introduces a dynamic system where the player's choices, actions, and relationships in one playthrough directly
affect their offspring who will appear as playable characters in future generations. This feature allows for multiple
story branches, providing an engaging and unique experience with every new game.

### Progeny Creation:

- At the end of each playthrough, the player's character may have children with NPCs, depending on the
  chosen faction and relationships established during that playthrough. Each child may inherit their parent's traits,
  abilities, and equipment, as well as a portion of their reputation within various factions.

- The player will be able to choose which offspring they would like to carry over into the next generation for further
  development. This choice can be influenced by factors such as the child's abilities, alignment with certain factions,
  or personal preference.

- The playerâ€™s character will have a unique name and backstory for each new playthrough, which may include details about
  their past affiliations, skills, or motives. This helps establish a sense of continuity between different playthroughs
  while still allowing for variety.

**Character Development and Reputation:**

- Each new playthrough will feature one or more of the player's descendants as a playable character. Their appearance,
  abilities, and starting equipment will be determined by their parents' choices and actions in previous playthroughs.

- The descendant's reputation within each faction will be based on the family's collective history. Positive actions
  taken by previous generations may grant bonuses or advantages, while negative actions could result in penalties or
  disadvantages.

- To maintain balance between factions, players will only be able to ally themselves with one faction at a time.
  Choosing a faction will unlock unique abilities, quests, and storylines that cater specifically to that group's
  interests and objectives.

**Family Interactions and Legacy:**

- The player can track their family's history through an in-game legacy system. This feature allows players to view the
  lineage of their characters, highlighting key events, alliances, and achievements throughout multiple generations.

- As the game progresses, players will encounter their own descendants in various encounters
  and missions. The choices made during previous playthroughs will influence how these interactions unfold, creating a
  sense of connection between different characters and storylines.

In summary, the Evolving Legacy Mechanic adds an exciting layer of complexity and replayability to the game. By
constantly evolving the player's family line and their relationships with other groups, this feature encourages
exploration, experimentation, and immersion in the world.
