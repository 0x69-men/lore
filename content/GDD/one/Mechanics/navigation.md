Game features a vast and dynamic game world that is designed to be explored and navigated by players as
they progress through their journey. The game world is divided into various regions, each with its unique landscape,
factions, resources, and challenges. As you traverse these regions, you will encounter numerous rest areas where you can
sleep and recharge your characterâ€™s stamina, health, and energy.

The branching paths within each region offer multiple routes for players to explore, with each path leading to a
different set of encounters, challenges, and story elements. By carefully choosing which paths to take, players can
influence the outcome of their game and shape the fate of the world in their own unique way. This system encourages
experimentation and rewards players who are willing to venture off the beaten path and explore the unknown corners of
the game world.

In addition to the branching paths between rest areas, each level within a region is also connected by multiple paths
that can be chosen by the player. The levels themselves will be randomized upon starting a new playthrough, ensuring
that every game experience is unique and presents new challenges and opportunities. As you progress further into the
game, the difficulty of navigating the terrain and overcoming obstacles will increase, testing your skills and pushing
you to adapt to new situations.

The different endings that can be achieved by following different paths in both levels and regions will offer players a
sense of variety and replayability, as they strive to uncover all the secrets and mysteries hidden within the world.
Ultimately, this mechanic allows for a more immersive and personalized experience, as players are able to shape their
own destiny and determine the course of events in the game world.
