Mechanics can broadly be defined as the ways players interact with the world and systems of the game, and the way those
systems give feedback or react to the player's actions.

You may also generally hear of mechanics being described in terms of player "verbs" and the ways the game responds to
them in contextâ€”in this case, the rules governing what the players can do and the rules governing what the game does. In
platformers like Super Mario Bros, running and jumping are core mechanics. In most first person shooters, traversing
terrain and shooting enemies are mechanics. In almost all visual novels, choosing options from dialogue trees is a main
mechanic.

The way you'll want to describe, illustrate and communicate your core mechanics may depend a bit on the project at hand,
but many designers find some kind of visual component useful here: storyboards, charts, diagrams, flowcharts, reference
art, short videos, whatever it is you find most useful for communicating your core mechanics, the better.

Stone Librande's GDC 2010
talk ([recapped here, with the full video embedded](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/video-one-page-designs)) gives
some strong ideas for condensing and illustrating design ideas: he was inspired by the thought of creating readable
solutions that folks would actually want to physically hang on their wall. You could take some of his inspiration and
create a one-page mechanics section that clearly illustrates your core gameplay loop(s) and high-level progression.

Guerilla Games quest designer and Gravity Ghost lead Erin Robertson Swink has
an [older blog here on Game Developer](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/5-alternatives-to-a-game-design-doc) 
detailing "alternatives" to GDDs that actually fit beautifully here in a mechanics section of a GDD. Designer and author
Steve Swink also has an [older blog resource](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/game-feel-the-secret-ingredient)
specifically on mechanics design and game feel that's extremely useful for parsing specific language and communication
around mechanics.
