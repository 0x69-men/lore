It's useful to have a section that speaks to the overall world of the game, and high-level notes on how players will progress through it or experience it. How is your world divided into sections: are there discrete levels? An overworld? Some means of traversal?

If you have levels or "physical" areas (as opposed to more abstract play areas like the screens of Tetris), a rough map can be very useful here. At the outset, it doesn't need to be extremely detailed or ornate, but a visual representation of how locations relate to one another can help everyone on the team "see" the world. You can use some of our [recommended free](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/the-best-free-tools-for-game-art) or [low-cost art tools](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/the-best-low-cost-tools-for-game-art) here to rough out simple 2D maps.

Reference art is also incredibly helpful in this section. Think mood board more than finished product (though if you are or have access to a concept artist, sketches are never a bad thing). Think about core geographical features—mountains, oceans, forests—as well as architectural elements: are there villages? Towns? Cities? Roughly what time period or style? Sci-fi? Fantasy? Vaporwave? If your game is an open-world adventure set on a sci-fi ocean planet, give some rough key visuals for style—cities in bubbles? Underwater stations built into massive coral cliffs?
