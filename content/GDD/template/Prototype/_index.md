In the context of a GDD, this might refer to simple paper prototypes—and gives me another excuse to link to Stone
Librande's fantastic [one-page designs resource](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/video-one-page-designs),
particularly his examples from The Simpsons, where he used paper and cardboard to create essentially a level design
prototype for the sprawling game.

Paper prototypes can be incredibly useful in solving design problems before spending too much time or money cooking them
up in-engine—but they do still take up effort, of course.

Another use for a prototyping section in your GDD is a dedicated area for proposing prototype ideas: you might list out
mechanics you want to prioritize here and plan to build prototypes for particularly unproven or unique ideas or twists
on mechanics. If you are creating a platformer where the core character is somehow bolted to a merry go round, and
experiences the game world in a state of constant rotation, you may want to build out some simple prototypes for basic
movement before you get to, say, minigame mechanics.
