## Project Description

A summary of what this game is about, without going into much detail about game mechanics or anything else. After
reading the Project Description, it should be clear what type of game you are trying to make (Social, Casual, Hardcore,
etc.) and the genre (Puzzle, RPG, FPS, etc.). Of course, you can add more information that feels relevant to your game.

This section would ideally be one or two paragraphs long. No more than a page for sure.

## 1 Characters

The reason we start with characters is because you need to introduce them before the Story. If your game doesn’t have
Characters and/or Story, you can just jump to the Gameplay section and remove Sections 1 to 3 (or leave them empty).

## 2 Story

“An important part of the art of storytelling is to create characters that the guests can empathize with easily, for the
more the guests can empathize with the characters, the more interesting the events become that happen to those
characters.” – Jesse Schell, Book of Lenses

Having introduced the characters, it’s a good time to talk about the events that will happen throughout the game.

## 2.1 Theme

“Resonant themes elevate your work from craft to art. An artist is someone who takes you where you could never go alone,
and theme is the vehicle for getting there.” - Jesse Schell, Book of Lenses

This is important for when other people read your design. Overall, the theme speaks about what kind of story you want to
tell: is it comedy, is it the real life or is it just fantasyyy... :)

## 3 Story Progression

So, you have a Story, but how will the game take your players through that story.

“The world of your game is a thing that exists apart. Your game is a doorway to this magic place that exists only in the
imagination of your players” – Jesse Schell, Book of Lenses

## 4 Gameplay

“The game begins with an idea.” - Jesse Schell, Book of Lenses

This is (probably in 99% of games) the most important section of the GDD. It’s where you describe what your Gameplay (
yes, with capital G), will be like.

Since this section can become humongous, we went ahead and divided it in sub-sections that made sense to us. Of course,
this is a very subjective topic and what works for us may not work for you.

## 4.1 Goals

In short, why is the player playing your game? It’s good to add this information to a separate section so you don’t have
to guess while reading through the whole GDD.

## 4.2 User Skills

This is not the most intuitive section, but it really helps to narrow down your scope if you think about what are the
skills your player needs to master in order to play your game. Believe us, writing this list will help you find problems
in your Game Design. For example, you may be trying to develop a game for kids but realize you require them to do
something that is too advanced for their age, or some inputs may be good for Mobile but not for a Console with a
Joystick. Also, if your game is going to have Custom HW built around it, then this list will allow you to figure out
what components you’ll need to make it work.

For example:

- Tap on the screen
- Drag and drop
- Memory
- Puzzle solving
- Rearranging pieces
- Manage resources
- Strategize

## 4.3 Game Mechanics

This is where you describe your proper game mechanics. Spare no words, when you circulate this GDD around your team,
there has to be the least reasonable amount of doubt about what the gameplay should be like. This is a very good section
to add some Artwork or Screenshots of your prototype (we prefer to prototype the mechanics and figure out if they are
fun before committing resources to a game).

There are complete books and sites with materials about how to describe game mechanics, so we’ll not elaborate with
examples here. Linked resources at the bottom.

## 4.4 Items and power-ups

We use this section to elaborate on the Game Mechanics. In order to avoid having a single section with everything in our
brains poured into it, we use the section above to describe the core mechanics, and this section to talk about things
that can be added to the game in order to improve the fun and empower the player.

So, if your game is a match-3 game, then in the previous section you’d go and describe exactly how a match-3 game would
work (and adding your variations to the formula).

In this section you’d add every power up and item the player can use/encounter/buy and how they would affect the core
gameplay.

For example:
> When finishing a world, you could get a power up
> related to that world. For example, finishing the
> volcano world, can give you an item that makes
> red Gnumies more powerful. It could be a scarf,
> or something they can wear, and those items could be
> seen in-game later. You can level up items using
> in-game currency, or use real money to acquire
> in-game currency packs….

## 4.5 Progression and challenge

This is also a very subjective section that may or may not work in your design. Our idea behind this section is to
elaborate on how the difficulty will increase throughout the game, and making sure we give the player the tools to catch
up to it.

For example:
> Difficulty will advance by making the enemies harder.
> To mitigate difficulty, the user will have to play better,
> level up Gnumies and use items (also level up the items).

Also, here we can talk about the way players will unlock new levels or missions.

For example:
> Each boss drops a key with a jewel of that world’s color.
> Worlds can be tackled in any order. When the user beats
> every world and has every key, then he can go and work
> his way through the last world. The order in which a user
> tackles each world can be chosen by him. The boss at the
> end of a world drops a key that can be used to open a
> different world. Once the item is used, it is lost forever.
> That way, the user must complete the world he selected
> before opening the next. At that point the difficulty for
> that world is set

## 4.6 Losing

Yes, losing! What are the losing conditions? Time, health, all of them? This is the section where you describe how the
player gets to see your "Game Over" screen.

For example:
> These are the losing conditions: losing by running out
> of time, losing by running out of moves, losing when
> there are no available combinations. When the player loses, there must be an image showing
> the Gnumies wounded/scratched. Maybe they can lose
> some hair and you can see the skin under the hair.

## 5 Art Style

This section is self-explanatory: here’s where you describe your ideas about what the game should look like. Since a
picture is worth a thousand words, this is a great place to add some concept art.

For example:
> This is a 2D isometric game, with high quality 2D sprites.
> The character design should resemble that of Studio Ghibli. Everything should be very colorful and feel alive, with
> highly animated scenarios and layered backgrounds….

## 6 Music and Sounds

“Music is the language of the soul, and as such, it speaks to players on a deep level.” – Jesse Schell, Book of Lenses

Here is where you describe your Music and Sound FX. Depending on how important this is in your game, then you can split
this section in different sub-sections.

For example:
> The music should have a Retro style, appealing to 8 bit
> nostalgia but high quality. It’s important that a lot of sound effects praise the user
> when he does something good. There should be immediate
> and positive feedback. When time is running low, add a sound that makes the
> user nervous. The sad scenes should be accompanied by Accordion/Violin
> music and sound like a sorrowful Tango.For In-Game music, use a more relaxed approach with
> happy tunes and going up on tempo as the level progresses.
> When in caves the music should sound muffled.

## 7 Technical Description

Here’s where you describe the platforms you’d be launching for and tools you’ll be using or are considering to use
throughout your development. This should not be a detailed technical description, for that you have the Technical Design
Document (TDD). Here we are just scratching the surface.

Example:

Initially, the game will be Mobile Cross-platform:

• iOS
• Android
• Windows Phone

Follow with PC standalone version and Facebook Canvas.

Could add Mac and/or console support (through e-stores)
in a future.

Consider the following engines: Marmalade, Unity 3D,
Unreal Engine 4.

For project management use JIRA. Use Perforce for
storing code and assets.

TBD properly in Technical Design Document.

## 8 Marketing & Funding

A completely optional section, but write your ideas now so you don’t forget them later. It’s important to think about
how you are going to market your game, even before starting your development. It’s also important to know where the
money to make the game is coming from.

“A plan is a real thing.” – Jesse Schell, Book of Lenses

For example:
> Prototype the first level, and launch a Kickstarter campaign
> where we show that level.Try to land a publishing deal. Is there any Government funding we can apply to?Create a press
> kit and send to gaming news websites.Start a YouTube Channel and post development diary
> videos.Etc.…

## 8.1 Demographics

It’s important to know who you’ll be targeting, this should spill into the game design. If you are targeting 15 to 25
year old males, then your main character probably shouldn’t be a pink pony (not that there’s anything wrong with that).

Example:
> Age: 12 to 50 Sex: EveryoneCasual players mostly

## 8.2 Platforms & Monetization

You can add a little more detail about how you are going to approach the release on each platform.

For example:
> Initially: Free android app with in-game ads, and paid
> version without ads. Free iOS with ads. Paid iOS version without ads.In game purchases.Consider: Windows 8, Windows
> Phone 8, XBOX live
> and Nintendo e-shop.

## 8.3 Localization

Your supported languages. Just add whatever you have in mind, this is something that probably won’t be a priority until
later.

Example:
> Initially English/Spanish.
> Later update with: Italian, French, German, etc.Consider getting an Asian publisher for expanding
> to Asia, someone that can help with localization.

## 9 Other Ideas

Another completely optional section. If you have ideas that you are not sure if they should go in the game or not, just
add them here so you don’t forget them.

For example:

- Level designer
    - Be able to rate levels created by other users
    - Achievements
    - Leaderboards
    - Should the game have a Multiplayer mode?

“Generally, it is safe to assume that a multiplayer online game will take four times the effort and expense to create
compared to a similar single-player game.”

“There is an old rule of thumb that it takes six months to balance your game after you have a completely working
version” – Jesse Schell, Book of Lenses
