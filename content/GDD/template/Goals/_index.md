It's good to keep your goals in mind at every step of the way, and having a dedicated goals section in your GDD can
serve as a beacon for tough decisions along the development process.

This is an excellent place to define player experience goalsâ€”always centering what you want your player to feel as they
are playing your game. Do you want them to feel challenged intellectually? Relaxed and happy in a cozy environment? Do
you want them to feel like a nimble creature in a series of increasingly dazzling platformer challenges? Do you want to
scare the living daylights out of them? Be very specific about your player experience goals and note how you will design
for them.

You may also want to include sales goals, target demographics, or goals for the game as an expression of your ideas.
What do you want to accomplish with this game as a piece of art, cultural artifact, or commercial project? Your specific
project will dictate the importance of any of these given areas, but it's important to know what you want to accomplish
by making this particular game.
