If your game features audio (and most do!) it can be useful to include high-level notes on sound design or musical needs
here in the GDD.

A media list can also be helpful here. Do you need 12 pieces of music, assigned by level? Perhaps you need a set of 9
different "sparkle" sound effects to add flavor to your cotton candy crystals level. Maybe you need ten death cries for
your avian zombie enemies. Will you be using voice actors in the project, or have dialogue play out in text on screen (
perhaps with accompanying sound effects)?

You don't want to go overboard on detail in this section unless you are also the sound designer for the project: but
having clear, concise language or examples ("think of the chime from Ocarina of Time for when we open a magic portal")
can go a long way in helping your team "hear" the game come together.
