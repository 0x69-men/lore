title: "Introduction"

This should be a brief introduction to the project itself, often with a very clear vision statement outlining the
high-level pitch for the game and what makes it special.

When I have my own game design students write introductions, I suggest that they lead with a vision statement, a
logline, and a gameplay synopsis. The vision statement should convey exactly what this game will be, why it will be
interesting or fun, why and how it will be unique. The logline is a one sentence description of the game, and the
gameplay synopsis should be kept short and sweet: just a couple of paragraphs about the core gameplay loop(s) and
overall structure.
