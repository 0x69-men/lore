Not every game has charactersâ€”but if your game does, it's useful to have notes and sketches here for who they are and
how they'll feature in the project.

A [character web](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/it-builds-character-character-development-techniques-in-games) that
shows characters' relationships can be very helpful (again, as long as it is clear and easy to parse) for projects with
multiple characters and interpersonal dynamics.

As with the game world section, some reference or concept art goes a long way here. Even if it is just rough and ready,
visuals can give a sense of who these people are, how they go about their lives and how they relate to one another over
the course of the game's events.
