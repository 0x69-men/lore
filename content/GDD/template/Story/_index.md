Some games have no story at all, and some live and die by their narrative elements (like visual novels, most kinds of
adventure games, and many kinds of RPG). You might have anything from a simple premise like "you are a little guy on an
island rolling sausages so they are fully cooked," to a Baldur's Gate 3-length script, with hundreds of characters and
seemingly endless story beats. Here perhaps even more than any other portion of a GDD, your documentation will vary
wildly with your project's overall goals and chosen genre.

If your game is light on story, a logline, rough synopsis, or brief outline of the plot will do very nicely here. If it
is a very story-rich game, you'll likely want to build out all of the above, and then provide links to other story
documentation, including more detailed outlines, interactive story documents, scripts, or other resources depending on
your specific needs.
