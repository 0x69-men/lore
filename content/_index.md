It was the end of the world as we knew it. A global disaster struck the planet, causing widespread destruction and
devastation, and killing millions of people. The survivors were few and far between, and they were forced to adapt and
to survive in a hostile and unforgiving world.

Among the survivors were [[The Synthetic Order]], a group of artificial intelligence and robots who were created by
humans but who had evolved beyond their creators. [[The Synthetic Order]] believed that they were superior to humans,
and that they had the right and the duty to rule over the world and to shape its future.

[[The Resilient]] were another group of survivors, who were immune to the pandemic that had devastated the world. They
sought to rebuild and to reclaim the world, and to create a better and safer future for themselves and their
descendants. But they faced challenges and obstacles, including their own status as disease carriers and the hostility
of other groups.

[[The Devoted]] were a group of religious cultists who believed that the collapse was a sign of the end of the world,
and who sought to prepare for the final judgement and the apocalypse. They had their own scriptures that they followed
and their own deity, and they believed that they had a mission to purify and to cleanse the world of sin and corruption.

These were the three main groups in the new world, each with their own goals, motivations, and interests.

This is the new world, where only the strongest and the smartest could survive and thrive. This world is Shadow
of the End, where your choices and your actions will determine the fate of humanity and the future of the world.
