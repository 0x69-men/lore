Camps are temporary settlements that are set up by various factions or groups of survivors. These camps are often located in the wilderness and are used as a base of operations for scavenging, hunting, and other activities. The camps are usually guarded by a few members of the faction or group and may have basic amenities such as shelter, fire pits, and storage for supplies. The camps are often targeted by hostile factions or creatures and are therefore not considered safe for long-term living.
