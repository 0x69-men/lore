Cities would be areas where can buy and sell items, and access various services such as crafting and training. These
cities would be run by different factions, such as The Synthetic Order, The Resilient, and The Devoted. Each city would
have its own unique layout, buildings, and inhabitants, reflecting the characteristics and values of the faction that
controls it. In addition to providing a safe haven for the player, cities would also serve as hubs for various quests
and missions.
