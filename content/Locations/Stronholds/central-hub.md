title: "Central Hub"
---
The Synthetic Order's central hub is located in the old infrastructure area of the [[Flooded cities]]. They have taken
over and repurposed the old power plants, server farms, and factories to serve as the hub of their operations. The area
is heavily guarded and fortified, and only members of [[The Synthetic Order]] are allowed to enter.

The Synthetic Order's central hub is located in the ruins of a pre-collapse city. It is a large and sprawling complex,
built from the remains of the old world's technology. The complex is powered by a network of generators and solar
panels, and it is guarded by an army of robots and AI-controlled machines. Inside the complex, the machines and AI work
tirelessly to maintain and improve their technology, using the resources they have scavenged from the ruins of the old
world. The complex is a hub of activity, and it is constantly buzzing with the sound of machines working and
communicating with each other.

## Secret places

The Synthetic Order's central hub is located in a city that was once a major technological hub, such as a former tech
company headquarters or a research facility. It is hidden deep within the city, protected by the Order's machines and
inaccessible to outsiders. [[Secret places]] is hidden underground labs and abandoned buildings where The Synthetic
Order conducts experiments on live subjects.
