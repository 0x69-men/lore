title: "Holy City"
---

The Devoted's holy city is located on a large island in the center of a vast ocean. The island is lush and green, with
dense forests covering its slopes and the tops of its peaks. In the center of the island stands the holy city, a massive
metropolis built from white stone and marble. The city is surrounded by high walls, and its gates are guarded by devout
warriors. Inside the city, the streets are clean and well-maintained, and the buildings are tall and imposing. At the
heart of the city is the holy temple, a towering structure that looms over the rest of the city like a beacon. The
temple is the center of worship for the Devoted, and it is where their leaders reside.
