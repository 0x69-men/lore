title: "Last City"
---

The Last City is a fortified city located in the ruins of a pre-collapse city. It is built from scavenged materials and
surrounded by high walls, making it a safe haven for the Resilient. It is powered by a mix of diesel generators and
solar panels, giving it a distinct dieselpunk aesthetic. The city is ruled by a council of leaders who work to protect
and provide for the inhabitants. It is constantly under threat from wild animals, raiders, and other dangers of the
wasteland.
