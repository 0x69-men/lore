The world is one of desolation and decay. After the collapse, much of the world's infrastructure
was destroyed, and many cities were flooded or contaminated by radiation. The environment has become hostile and
inhospitable, with few areas remaining habitable for human life.

The world is now divided into several different regions, each controlled by one of the three main factions: [[The
Synthetic Order]], [[The Resilient]], and [[The Devoted]]. The Synthetic Order controls the city centers and the remnants of the
old world's technology, while The Resilient inhabit the rural areas and scavenge for resources. The Devoted live in
isolated communities and follow their own strict religious laws.

In addition to these three main factions, there are also smaller groups and communities scattered throughout the world.
Some of these groups are friendly and willing to trade, while others are hostile and will attack on sight.
